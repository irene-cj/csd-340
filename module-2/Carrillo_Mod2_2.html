        <h2> A summary about me </h2>
        <p> Hello everyone, my name is Irene Carrillo Jaramillo and I am from Iowa.
    Iowa in my point of view is a very lonely but beautiful state. 
    I hope to move to a bigger city and far more warmer one.
        </p>
        <p> I was born and raised in Iowa. I have 2 younger siblings. My mom and my siblings are the 
    only family I have here in Iowa that is why I am very close to them.
    I am a very family oriented person. I love to spend time with my family and friends.
        </p>
        <p> I am currently attending Bellevue University. I am majoring in Software Development.
    I did not always know what I wanted to do in life. I was very indecisive. 
    When I started college I was originally a business major, however I did not
    have a passion for it. I decided to change my major after one day I got to learn HTML and 
    CSS in my MIS class. I fell in love with it. I knew that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p> I will graduate this year and I am very excited to see what the future holds for me.
    I am very excited to learn more about HTML and CSS in this class. 
    I hope to learn more about web development and become a better software developer.
        </p>
